a program to saved colors and get it hex value as well.
 So the program works by sliding the sliders to create a color vis touch controls or mouse in emulator. 
you then can saved the colors by hitting the purple button called save color. 
after you can selected any saved colors can make changes to it then save it as a differnt color in the list. 

let me know if there any more bugs with the program or with the hexcode(should be right tested it and white showned up as #FFFFFF),
